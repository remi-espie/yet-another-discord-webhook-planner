# üìÖ Yet Another Discord WebHook Planner

## What is this ‚ùì

This is a simple Discord WebHook Planner üìÖ, which allows you to fetch your events from a .ics online and display them in Discord through a webhook.

It displays 2 categories of events:
- courses, which are displayed as a list of events for the current day. It also displays the hour of the first and last event of this category.
- important, which are important events that are displayed as a list of events for the current day.

Moreover, it displays the events of today and tomorrow, but only if there are events for these days.  
Besides, it displays a weather forecast for the day.  
Else, it doesn't send a message.

It uses a `.env` file which contains your personal data, see [`.env.example`](.env.example):

If you're a French student, you might be interested in getting the meal of the day in your favorite [CROUS restaurant](https://www.etudiant.gouv.fr/fr/vous-restaurer-1903).  
Using [HackTheCrous](https://hackthecrous.com/)'s API, another message will be posted with the day's menu *if there are event on this day*.
Just add the restaurant `ID` in the `.env` file for it to work automatically. 

## üöÄ Getting started

### Get a correct .ics !

This little script is made to work with specifics .ics file; it assumes that your relevant events: 
- are in the `VEVENT` section of the file, and that the `SUMMARY` field contains the name of the event.
- have the property `CATEGORIES` set to `Cours` if it is a course, or `Important` if it is an important event.

I personally used [Calendar.online](https://calendar.online/) as it is free, allow to fetch multiple data sources and can be edited by anyone from a link without login.

### Get a free OpenWeatherMap api key !

The script also fetch the weather for the day from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). For it to work, you will have to add an api key to the `.env` file.  
To create an api key, you will need at least an OpenWeatherMap **free** account. Check [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### Get Go or see [releases](https://github.com/remi-espie/yet-another-discord-webhook-planner/releases)

First import the dependencies with `go get -d ./...`.

Then update the `.env` file with your own data:
```
WEBHOOK_URL= # Your webhook URL
ICS_URL= # Your .ics URL
AVATAR_URL= # Your avatar URL
OWM_KEY= # Your OpenWeatherMap api key
LONGITUDE= # The longitude of where you'd like to know the weather
LATITUDE= # The latitude of where you'd like to know the weather
```

Finally just run `go run main.go` and it will fetch the set ics and sent the data to your webhook.

You could also build it with `go build main.go` and run it with `./main`.

#### The only release available was built with and for Linux x86_64.
